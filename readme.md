# Personal Profile Page Project

## Project Goals

- Create a portfolio website showcasing deployed projects that is readable on multiple screen sizes

(both employer and employee user stories were added to get a better idea of the overall goal)

## User Story - Employer

- AS AN Employer
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## User Story - Employee

- AS A Professional Front End Web Developer
- I WANT a webpage that showcases my experience and projects I have created in web design
- SO THAT my portfolio is optimized for potential employers to see what my capabilities are

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their
  work and how to contact them

- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize that page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout

## An HTML issue was opened to document the changes requested
